	:Description:
		This extension provides LDAP support for TYPO3 by delegating the authentication of frontend and/or backend users
		to the centrally-managed directory of your organization. It fully supports OpenLDAP and Active Directory and is
		capable of connecting securely to the authentication server using either TLS or SSL (ldaps://).

		In case of use in an intranet environment, this extension is a perfect match since it natively brings Single
		Sign-On (SSO) capability to TYPO3 without any complex configuration.
